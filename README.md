# Thaumcraft-Integration

A mod that integrates aspects ofÂ Thaumcraft into other modifications that do not support it. Example of work in Images.
This mod is under active development.

At the moment (version 0.1), the modification integrates other mods through various oredicts, it is assumed that in the future there will be direct integrations. You can find a list of all oredicts here(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ytp25U5-H3lQR9Co3NFsl0lk4EVEQQBfl7K0ZvDhYt8/edit?usp=sharing).
With the help of OreDict, mods were partially integrated:
Applied Energistics 2
Astral Sorcery
Avaritia 1.1
Buildcraft
Draconic Evolution
Forestry
Immersive Engineering
Industrial Craft
Industrial Foregoing
Mekanism
The Aether
Thermal Series
Tinkers Construct
and others that use the same OreDict.

When TC7 by Team COFH is release, i will port this mod for new version.
